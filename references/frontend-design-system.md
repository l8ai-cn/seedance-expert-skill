# Frontend Design System

This repository has no application frontend. The user-facing frontend is the GitHub README plus SVG assets.

## Design goals

- Clean, cinematic, high-contrast presentation.
- No collapsed Markdown.
- No overloaded neon copy.
- Usable on GitHub mobile and dark mode.
- Clear start-here decision path.
- Validation commands visible above the fold after the skill map.

## Asset rules

- SVG only; no external scripts, images, fonts, or tracking.
- Include `<title>` and `<desc>` for accessibility.
- Keep hero width at 1200px and height under 520px.
- Use cards and restrained gradients, not dense decorative noise.

## README rules

- No line longer than 500 characters.
- Tables should have real newlines.
- Every major section should answer a user decision: what is it, where do I start, what skills exist, how do I validate, what changed.
- Bitmap hero art should contain no embedded text, logos, or watermarks; keep real project text in Markdown for accessibility.
